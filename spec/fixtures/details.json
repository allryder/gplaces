The office locates at a very strategic place - in CBD and has wonderful view over the harbor. Really enjoy having lunch outside to enjoy the wind and fresh air for inspiration (but watch out for flying dishes because of strong wind). However, food is kinda lack of the variety comparing to other offices. The plus is food station is almost everywhere which feed you very well (be careful of gaining so much weight). There will usually be surprise when you work here: Ice Cream, Nexus 7, Chrome notebook, Nexus and many other swags. There are a lot of trees inside the building which I really like it - so fresh !",

Woopdi they have given themselves great pay and a great office and free food. I hope you choke on it. Stop patting your self on the back and try listening to small business and actually doing some work instead of having meetings and discussing how good you think you all are. PS. Lets see if you keep this review, or delete it. BECAUSE ITS TRUE!!!!!!",
